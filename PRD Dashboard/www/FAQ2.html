The Minimum Household Budget is the bare minimum cost of household basics necessary to live and work in the modern economy. These basic budget items include housing, child care, food, transportation, health care, and technology (a smartphone plan), plus taxes and a contingency (miscellaneous) fund equal to 10% of the household budget. The budget is calculated separately for each county and for different household types.<br>
<br>
The Minimum Household Budget largely reflects the work of <strong><u><a href="22ALICE_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United for ALICE</a></u></strong>. ALICE® stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed and includes households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level yet struggle to afford basic expenses.  
<br><br>
In specific instances, the CLIFF suite of tools may incorporate different values for food and health care costs than those provided by United For ALICE. For example, ALICE assumes that a household participates in an employer-sponsored health insurance plan when available. In contrast, CLIFF tools determine and assign the most cost-effective bundle for a household’s health care needs. This could include a scenario in which an adult participates in an employer insurance plan while children in the household receive Medicaid. Additionally, there are scenarios in which the CLIFF suite of tools may incorporate slightly different food costs than the calculations produced by United For ALICE. Specifically, the value of any benefit in the CLIFF suite of tools, including those associated with food expenditures, cannot exceed the cost of the associated expense.

The calculations for public assistance programs, taxes, and tax credits are produced using the <strong><u><a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/economic-mobility-and-resilience/advancing-careers-for-low-income-families/policy-rules-database.aspx" target="_blank" >Policy Rules Database.</a></u></strong>

To estimate taxpayer savings we assume that a person who transitions off of a public assistance program with a wait list is not replaced by another person.
