<div>
<h4>
<strong>What types of income are assumed to be $0?</strong>
</h4>
</div>
The following types of income affect eligibility for some programs and are assumed to be $0 for the purposes of generating calculations in this tool: unemployment insurance, pensions, and state disability payments.
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>What is non-taxable cash assistance?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
In this tool, non-taxable assistance is counted as gift income. Gift income is not subject to income or FICA taxes, but will count as income for some public assistance programs. Gift income is different from stipends. 
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>How is out-of-pocket health insurance cost determined?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
For purposes of calculating net financial resources, PRD automatically calculates the out-of-pocket cost of health insurance based on the lowest cost option the household is eligible for. To determine the potential set of health insurance options PRD takes into consideration the programs you select from the list and the cost of purchasing health insurance through an employer. The cost of health insurance (both the total cost and the unsubsidized out-of-pocket cost) varies by source. For example, the premium paid each month will depend on whether the person is receiving Employer Sponsored Health Insurance, Medicaid/CHIP, or health insurance through the Health Exchange Marketplace.

<div>
<h4> 
<strong>How do the results differ for persons with disabilities?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
This tool incorporates special rules for individuals with disabilities for the following programs: SSDI, SSI, Medicaid, SNAP, Section 8 and Federal Income Taxes. In some states, children with disabilities may be subject to different rules for the CCDF program; these state-specific rules are not incorporated. The following programs count SSI and SSDI income towards eligibility: SNAP, WIC, School Meals, Head Start/Early Head Start, and Section 8.
<br>
<div>
<h4> 
<strong>Are eligibility redetermination periods factored in to these calculations?</strong>
</h4>
  </div>
Some programs have probational periods where participants are able to keep a benefit for some period after they are no longer eligible - for example, if their income passes a threshold. Probational periods vary by state and program and are not factored in to the PRD.

Benefits Cliff
</h2>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p style="font-size:18px">Some working families experience financial barriers to economic mobility. One significant barrier occurs when career advancement puts them above the income eligibility threshold for public assistance programs. Due to the loss of these programs, career advancement opportunities may result in the family being worse off (a benefits cliff) or no better off (a benefits plateau) financially than before the wage increase.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p style="font-size:18px">This loss of means-tested public assistance is an effective marginal tax rate on income gains. High effective marginal tax rates mean that some workers have a financial disincentive to invest in their own human capital and advance from lower-wage work to jobs that lead to economic self-sufficiency. The severity of benefits cliffs and plateaus depends on factors such as the worker's family composition and geographical location.</p>
